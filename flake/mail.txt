Subject: need your help...

Oliver Shrub, Gardens Department Head, keeps bragging about his high score for this rip off Snake game called Flake. I'm pretty sure he found a way to cheat the game because there is no way it's possible to score 10,000 points...I mean the game ships with a sketchy TXT file so there must be something fishy going on here.

Can you look at the game and let me know how I can beat Oliver's high score?

Best,

Nox
Shadows Department Head
